[1.13-1.16.x];
This section is dedicated to just public Java Spigot projects.  These projects actually are being maintained at times, expect a wide variety of well functioning Minecraft plugins in there.  If you are in need of a manual then please consider consulting my Spigot MC page. ( https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/kvinnekraft.864628/ )


[Discontinued];
This section is dedicated to also just public Java Spigot projects, the difference here though is that I am not updating these codes like I do with the above.  As a matter of fact, all of the projects found in this folder are projects that I used to learn the A.P.I.  Even though some of them may function properly am I unable to guarantee any functionality.


[F.Y.I.];
If you do find any issues in the "1.13-1.16.x" section then please contact me at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com rather than leaving an issue on here.  I do not guarantee any time with in I am going to respond but it is your greatest chance at contacting me.
