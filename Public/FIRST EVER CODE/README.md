Every single file within these folders are considered first time projects.

Eight years ago when I first got into C# programming I basically went on a spree within the span of two weeks in order to build this entire shit.  Yes, shit.  The codes are shit and so
are the ideas for the projects.  But hey, that is where we all start.  Anyways, do not expect
anything to work.  There are exploits in there I think and some small malware for self educational purposes only.  The codes are for anyone, you are responsible for that what you do with it though.  -Dashie
