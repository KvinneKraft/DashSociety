Libraries:  The core fundamental part of my workspace, this is where I store all of my libraries, the ones that I would like to
  have out on the internet.  You can use them or let me know how to improve them.  If you have anything that you would like to add
  to them then please let me know.  I will add it for ye if it lives up to my definition of usable.

Released:  This directory only contains released projects, applications that you can download and use right now.  They are not
  meant for commercial use but more so for self satisfactory use.  I code to satisfy myself with the outcome.

Unreleased:  This directory only contains projects that are being worked on at the time.  The codes are public but there is no
  guarantee for functionality whatsoever, if you are making use of this folder then it is on your own risk.
