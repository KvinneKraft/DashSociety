About:  This application was made because I had nothing to download files directly with at the
  time, I was stuck to web restrictions and what not so I figured why not make my own downloader
  rather than depend on my sh1tty 4ss browser.  Haha.  It should work just fine, if not, let me
  know, peace out!
