>This section is kind of inactive as of now, I am mainly active in the Portfolio repository.  You can still find usable material in here though.  I just have it as a fall-back whenever I forget something from my past code.

Released:  This directory only contains released projects, applications that you can download and use right now.  They are not
  meant for commercial use but more so for self satisfactory use.  I code to satisfy myself with the outcome.

Unreleased:  This directory only contains projects that are being worked on at the time.  The codes are public but there is no
  guarantee for functionality whatsoever, if you are making use of this folder then it is on your own risk.
  
>Again, repository Portfolio is the most active.
